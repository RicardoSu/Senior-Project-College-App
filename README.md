<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>
   <p>
    This application was quite complex and with many challenges from the beginning, it was the most time-consuming and complicated I have ever made. 💪<br> 
    My experience with Java and Firebase increased a lot after this app, it was challenging and that in the middle of the way there were a lot of mistakes, which further increased my curiosity and desire to learn more.<br>
    I learned a lot about Firebase, and I loved its speed of action and structuring. Some mistakes were a little silly, but they made me be more attentive, like a simple space after creating a field haha. <br>
    I was also having a problem logging in users, and I realized that the error was in the as signup_screen folder, it was fixed, and the problem was resolved.<br>
    There were many learnings, and that I will take all of them to my career. 🚀
